```List on what will require much testing when a dev build gets released```
- Saving data to mysql
- Loading data from mysql
- Auto sync between proxy using mysql
- The action system (actions.yml)
- Loading factions from file
- Saving factions to file
- Deleting factions while a member is offline an check if every command works

**Currently I can't give a dev build, because I have fatal errors to fix that prevent me from compiling it to a useable jar file**
tobero: 
Okay, the spigot version launched the first time on my test server - It doesn't add any in game commands, etc yet, but that's work in progress
tobero: 
Wow, the plugin now has a size of ~ 9MB and that without any features being added
tobero: 
If someone wants to help me, I have settled onto a new language system. Its no longer a json, now they are xml files.

I have started to add translatable messages. Because of focusing on writing the code, I can't make all messages. That's why I'm asking if someone is able to translate the files / correct my grammar, typo, etc.

https://github.com/ToberoCat/ImprovedFactions_new/blob/main/core/src/main/resources/lang/en_us.xml
This is the file, all `PLACEHOLDERS` are just a quick way for me to add it into the file, but they still have to get their content.
If you'd like to help, make a fork, update the values you want to change / add and make a pull request
jokbon: 
kk will check after have time
tobero: 
Yeah, no stress, Josh already took some of his valuable time and helped
tobero: 
I don't know if I should post it yet, but the first useable dev build is now finished.
It currently adds the entire underlying code structure, but only adds the create / delete faction command
jokbon: 
XD do claiming and then post, dont add anything more lol
jokbon: 
that one just without any aditional files
tobero: 
Yeah, will add it
jokbon: 
like get rid of rest code just claim and f create
jokbon: 
as a test build for claiming stability
jokbon: 
later one by one map etc
jokbon: 
best if separate
tobero: 
Yeah, the biggest things that require testing is the cross compatibility between mysql and local, like when switching between they data should get used even when stored in other medium
tobero: 
Things that will require much testing will be things like velocity / multipaper
jokbon: 
i think you can just do only mysql
tobero: 
No, because not all server hosts provide a mysql db
jokbon: 
people can host themselves or free hosts
tobero: 
btw, this will have it's one year anniversary on 24. August
tobero: 
Yeah, still it isn't much effort for me adding a local option
jokbon: 
Easy to add hard to make it work
jokbon: 
Other factions have like 3 developers and yours is most advanced but also most buggy
jokbon: 
Maybe even more developers, cause forking
tobero: 
Yeah, I'm working on creating the perfect version of this plugin
jokbon: 
So i expect like 10ppl behind vs 1
jokbon: 
üòÇ üòÇ
tobero: 
Yeah, maybe this one is more advanced because it's pretty simple and tries to add features people want that are actually using it. I don't know how others come up with features
jokbon: 
Oh u will be suprised, they have alot, but theyr plugin base is stupid basic
tobero: 
Yeah, I mean like they add features no body needs. At least when I was playing on a faction server (Long ago) I was overwhelmed by the amount of too complicated features
tobero: 
There where no guis, which made it easier to manage or something
jokbon: 
https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/improved-factions.95617/
jokbon: 
Pinned a message.
tobero: 
Okay, next dev build will be finished in one to two days. It will include all dev report issues and claiming
josh65: 
does it inclue the mass claiming feature
tobero: 
Yep
tobero: 
The claim now as a area
tobero: 
Like radius 2 will claim all 25 chunks around you in a radius of 2
tobero: 
But the world edit like isn't included
josh65: 
Is there a reason why the max radius for claim and unclaim commands are in a different folder in separate files. Would make more sense as a few lines in the config file
tobero: 
Yeah, they are as these files will contain alias, command cost, etc. I just thought it looks nices when you don't have to deal with nested config sections and instead have different files for it
josh65: 
So i just realised mass editing commands properties will be kind of annoying with more of them since the user has to open every file and then manually put the value in rather then replace all, properly only an issue if you were to make all the commands the same cost. Finding aliases may also be annoying if the user is debuging conflicts.
josh65: 
@[Dev] Tobero do you have an estimated time for a dev 3 release?
jokbon: 
1 week + math ü§£ 
https://komodomath.com/uploads/site/2013/05/scary_math.jpg
tobero: 
I would have to test the chunk protection, but when that's done, I can release the invite dev build. Next one will probably introduce guis
jokbon: 
tobero how beta permisions work?
jokbon: 
do they have defaults or i need to costumize from 0
tobero: 
How do you mean that?
tobero: 
They are nodes in the plugin.yml
tobero: 
Where you have to define if they are op or not op
josh65: 
is the a reason for the black description items in the translation file. Its on all the item translations.

josh65: 
also what should i use for dynamic infomation e.g. current faction name. Some are using {} and other use %%
josh65: 
@[Dev] Tobero
tobero: 
%% for papi placeholders
{} for placeholders that only exist within a command
tobero: 
It's  blank line. I just styled it
josh65: 
alright

tobero: 
Yep. I'll post it into #‚ï∞Ôºû‚ùî„Öêquestions as a post so I can refer to it

josh65: 
think it the same issue i had trying to build it myself
tobero: 
Have you tried removing the entire ImprovedFactions folder?
josh65: 
il try now
josh65: 
nope still the same
tobero: 
What server version are you using?
josh65: 
Paper 1.18.2 build 387
tobero: 
Okay, can you send me your entire latest log?
tobero: 
Have you tried building it yourself or is it the file I uploaded to github?
josh65: 
It the file from github
tobero: 
Oh, it was an issue with an worldguard command. I'll remove it temporarily, but will add it back later (File is uploading right now)
josh65: 
what's the world guard command?
tobero: 
It scans all regions (with an filter of course) and marks them with the zone you want
tobero: 
Just to speedup chunk protection
tobero: 
https://github.com/ToberoCat/ImprovedFactions_new/releases/tag/v2.0.0-dev.5.1

Here is the file
josh65: 
that fixed it thanks
tobero: 
No problem
tobero: 
Here's the guide for the fancy messages

https://discord.com/channels/819932760550014986/1049423763059515544
josh65: 
Are the new GUI for settings suppose to work? For me clicking an item doesn't do anything
tobero: 
No, they aren't. Right now they should only get displayed (Which to be true was the hardest part)
josh65: 
Alright
josh65: 
Is there a max power value to be used in the lang files. None of them work from what i can see on there.
tobero: 
Right now there isn't but I'm working on a system that allows you to access any field of a faction using java reflect (That's the cause of the weird name for eg. faction_getDisplayName. It's actually Faction#getDisplayName).

If you want to see every (soon) available usable placeholder, here is the faction interface:
https://github.com/ToberoCat/ImprovedFactions_new/blob/main/core/src/main/java/io/github/toberocat/improvedFactions/core/faction/Faction.java

Starting from line 108. All methods starting with `get` will return something
tobero: 
Just so you know, I'm planning on releasing v2.0.0 the next two - three weeks, so I'll finally finish
jokbon: 
my country became more green by placing 1000000bilion strees in one year!!!!!
if there is tree from past year they take it out and put new one to grow!

josh65: 
Is this a plugin issue? running factions v2 stable and GUI engine 1.2.2
`[GuiEngine] faction-detail-page.gui has a invalid component. Type faction-icon isn't recognized as a component`
jokbon: 
dose gui engine supports mini message?
jokbon: 
ü§¥
jokbon: 
since old formats lacking i think we need to try to get rid of old
jokbon: 
or just keep boths since some placeholders require it

jokbon: 
width 9 height 4
jokbon: 
but x = 8; z=3
jokbon: 
:iconpride:
jokbon: 
and like so everywhere XD
tobero: 
That's a key feature that you no longer work with slots, as I hat them the most - I don't really remember what goes where, so specifing x and y is much easier (at least for me)

Width is not relevant for rendering simple GUIs, but once you start using embedded ones, it makes sense to exist
jokbon: 
nono
jokbon: 
i mean the fact size is specified 1-9 while slot 0-8
jokbon: 
size starts from 1 while slot from 0
jokbon: 
xd
tobero: 
This is convention. A width of 0 makes no sense, while offset on the x axis of 0 makes sense, as it will be at the origin.

That's basically how programmers handle rects in coordinate space - At the end it will be converted into a lower x, lower y, upper x and upper y, so width is just something describing the differnce between these positions
jokbon: 
ye these things hilarious
jokbon: 
aray starts from 1
jokbon: 
xd
jokbon: 
(lol)
tobero: 
A funny little side note: The current stable dev branch is just a rewrite of the rewrite in kotlin with a few frameworks I've designed and used in my last two years - And all that in three days.


So in theory, v2.0.0 will be a rewrite of the cancelled rewrite
jokbon: 
oh god https://discord.com/channels/819932760550014986/998990362028806266/1138198608810877028
jokbon: 
what the fuck is this
tobero: 
You mean the config or the message I sent?
jokbon: 
i mean plugin is mess
jokbon: 
üòÇ
jokbon: 
from what i read
jokbon: 
zones oweride faction claims?
tobero: 
They don't as they're now a fully fledged feature with no quick workaround to get it working
jokbon: 
https://tenor.com/view/explosion-explote-fake-hand-elevator-door-bang-gif-13646447
jokbon: 
so thats no way its stable
jokbon: 
its like alpha
jokbon: 
xD
tobero: 
Trust me - it's less buggy than anything I've created yet
jokbon: 
üíÄ
tobero: 
I can tell that, because I've never had a single issue of the plugin crashing while testing - Even when I edited almost the entire SQLite file while running it - Not a single issue with that
tobero: 
I'm even pretty sure you can do the things I've mentioned in the config you should not do and the plugin would still be running
jokbon: 
weird
jokbon: 
cuz its hard to get it buggy
jokbon: 
can i have safezone
jokbon: 
and faction title not poping up in there
jokbon: 
Can zone protect players (safezone)
jokbon: 
Can "unclaimable land" prevent claims
jokbon: 
i gues no
jokbon: 
Isnt thats easyer to remove zones completely
jokbon: 
and put world guard to make that unclaimable/safezone/warzone land
tobero: 
All things you mentioned do work. And you can create your own zone, where worldguard handles everything
tobero: 
Not even normal claims can, because I forgot to add that
tobero: 
No, because worldguard will be a dependency I don't want to force people into using just to get basic stuff from factions
jokbon: 
world guard claims
jokbon: 
cant be owerclaimed by factions?
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero? does that work?
jokbon: 
and just put permisions
jokbon: 
factions.wgclaim.excempt.[claim name]
jokbon: 
ugh ?
jokbon: 
xd
tobero: 
Yes. You'll have create a zone removing all managed properties, and you have created dummy zone for worldguard.
jokbon: 
so ur plugin 100% usable then
jokbon: 
lol
tobero: 
Won't work. Worldguard works an with blocks and I use chunks. This will cause weird behavior
tobero: 
Yes, what's missing?
jokbon: 
Yes. You'll have create a zone removing all managed properties, and you have created dummy zone for worldguard
config example? xd
jokbon: 
pls
jokbon: 
faction permisions: 
ALIE
NEUTRAL
ENEMY
tobero: 
Can add it. But you just have to set all things below protection to false when using unclaimed as template and it should work
josh65: 
Is the power system still a thing how does overclaimed/raids work now?
jokbon: 
omg stop confusing me
tobero: 
Permission - Yep, will come in later builds
Relations - I'm unsure about them

Power - Will come with a later build
jokbon: 
lol
jokbon: 
relations: its just switching to alie, neutral and enemy
tobero: 
I'm still not sure about how I want power to work, that's why I'll keep it for later
tobero: 
It's not the allies, more about the war relation
jokbon: 
.........
jokbon: 
okay i wish i started coding my own factions plugin
jokbon: 
lol
jokbon: 
since everything gets confusing
jokbon: 
also i wish i had table that wouldnt break
jokbon: 
when i smash my head to table
jokbon: 
poor tobero has no time for plugin üò¶
tobero: 
I promise, zones aren't as confusing as you might think they are. They just define if claiming is allowed, if titles should be announced, what the title should be displayed if no faction owns it and they also define what things get protected.
tobero: 
Started a thread.
tobero: 
https://github.com/users/ToberoCat/projects/3/views/1

I'll try to use this board to inform everyone about things I'm doing / will be doing, etc
tobero: 
Sorry, for no upates today, I've been busy writing code for my customers
tobero: 
I've upload the latest dev file on spigot, as won't have much time to make any changes this weekend. To keep my motivation for adding more features, I've released it to the public, which hopefully shows me that people care about my plugin
jokbon: 
u dont believe how much ppl care for it
tobero: 
I'm pretty sure the number is close to zero
jokbon: 
i just sweared
jokbon: 
lol
tobero: 
And the moderation bot didn't like that....
jokbon: 
nope it was discord thing
tobero: 
Yeah, this thing: https://discord.com/channels/819932760550014986/984472372818092083/1139991193296568471
jokbon: 
yes yes yes fk tobero anoying guy dont realise how much i need this plugin
tobero: 
You are just a single person - As I said, close to zero
jokbon: 
no
jokbon: 
thing is
jokbon: 
ur plugin is key to bigger support
jokbon: 
its like key to support other plugins
jokbon: 
yes there are plugins that are compatible with rest of mods
jokbon: 
but they are only for survival
jokbon: 
with unraidable stuff
jokbon: 
saberfactions dont support sheet
jokbon: 
with your plugin i could do costum maps
jokbon: 
costumn arenas
jokbon: 
saber is just like vanila minecraft
jokbon: 
but its worse
jokbon: 
its like vanila but incompatible with mods
tobero: 
Hm. So, the plugin isn't actually just usable for faction, but also for other stuff?
jokbon: 
yes
jokbon: 
more compatible project korra
jokbon: 
it doesnt have shiiiiiitty 2 zone claim witch restrict everything
jokbon: 
u dont realise how much people need this
jokbon: 
saber factions: no project korra in warzone
jokbon: 
it just stuborn shiiiit that make u walk thousand blocks
tobero: 
Yeah, but nobody will find it under the name of faction. Shouldn't I just create a fork of it, removing the faction stuff and releasing it as a completely different resource?
jokbon: 
in the end u get bored of walking when u just want to pvp
jokbon: 
they will
jokbon: 
people alredy finding it
tobero: 
That's a issue with the world setup. Owners have to make a small world
jokbon: 
just people got bored of ur bugs
tobero: 
That's true.
jokbon: 
only reason it currently unpopular
jokbon: 
when it gets fixed it will skyrocket in usage
tobero: 
Still, wouldn't it then make sense to kinda rename the plugin? If you think the plugin will be used for non faction stuff, why include that anyways?
jokbon: 
saber factions is stuborn shiiiit that does updates by people votes
people of 7year old (lets face truth most people in discord underage)
jokbon: 
vote the most useless features
tobero: 
You don't have to repeat the messages, I can see them in the mod tab
jokbon: 
making dev to work on useles stuff
jokbon: 
look at theyr discord
jokbon: 
suggestion tab
jokbon: 
they work on dumb features
jokbon: 
it only makes saber factions heavyer
jokbon: 
not more smart or more easy for owners
jokbon: 
its just a clutter of features that alredy exit in other plugins
tobero: 
Okay, so just so I get it right - People are still interested in factions or do they just like the features the plugin likes, giving a shi t about factions?
jokbon: 
dumest thought i seen a while
tobero: 
Why? It sounds like people will be using the plugin for non faction stuff
jokbon: 
hmm
jokbon: 
they name it "claim engine"
jokbon: 
xd
tobero: 
Nah... ImprovedFactions will probably stay, as I'm too lazy to remove the faction stuff again. Dumb thought, you're right
jokbon: 
to be honest i currently need good faction and good creative plot plugin
jokbon: 
that plotsquared keeps on corrupting world
tobero: 
Oh, why? Isn't plot squared the best plugin nobody hates for any reason /s (I hate this shit f plugin. A customer made me do stuff with it. At the end decompiled this shiiiit, modified their code to get mine working)
tobero: 
Yes, finally. My customer didn't want to accept my suffering
jokbon: 
lmao
jokbon: 
xD
tobero: 
I wasn't able to reload and had to stop & start the server every time I made changes. The restarting probably took more time than coding the plugin
jokbon: 
lmao dude
jokbon: 
see we all share same pains
jokbon: 
its easyer to make own plugin from scratch
than edit theyr ugly shiiiiit
tobero: 
It's just that my customer couldn't afford me to code a plot plugin, therefore he went with plotsquared
jokbon: 
how much u charged him
tobero: 
For the plugin interfacing with plotsquared 560‚Ç¨ (+ MySql support), The Plotsquared plugin would have cost him 840‚Ç¨ (With MySql support again)
jokbon: 
holy f
jokbon: 
thats huge
tobero: 
Yeah, but you know... That would have been at least 30 hours of coding when I count bug fixes and revisions
jokbon: 
thats monthly vage ngl
tobero: 
In Euros (‚Ç¨)?
jokbon: 
yes
tobero: 
Holy cow. That's.... less than I expected
jokbon: 
iam geting 667/month
jokbon: 
euros
tobero: 
For how many hours a week? 20/hrs?
jokbon: 
no
jokbon: 
65
tobero: 
A single week?
jokbon: 
wait
jokbon: 
i need to count cuz my sheldule fked rn
jokbon: 
in kinda work aditional hrs
jokbon: 
okay current vage is (if worked normaly)
863.52
jokbon: 
and currently iam geting 667 -  1400eur
jokbon: 
863.52 is 40hrs a week
tobero: 
Hm. What do you work as? Isn't that like 6‚Ç¨/h? Wasn't the minium wage 12‚Ç¨/h or something?
jokbon: 
5.14/h
jokbon: 
minimal vage
tobero: 
Okay, then it looks like we have a higher minimum wage in austria

Okay
jokbon:

jokbon: 
xD
jokbon: 
1: fix ur beta build
2: more __debuging__ shud be useful with __config__
3: colors shud be __minimesage__ and not old shiit
4: bukkit only can do sync, and not async on main thread
tobero: 
Yeah, don't worry, guiengine already utilities threads for interpretation
tobero: 
But number 3 sounds good. I'll probably support both
tobero: 
I'm not sure about number 2, what debugging methods do you want added?
jokbon: 
"item" x="0" y="3"
jokbon: 
they are being incorretly presented by debuger
jokbon: 
or misleadingly
jokbon: 
width="9" height="6 too
jokbon: 
It shoud say: 
Out of bounds gui size. line [] column
Out of bounds gui item location. line [] column
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero when i was debuging it presented wrong line
jokbon: 
and wrong column
tobero: 
I'm still confused what you mean with debugging. GuiEngine doesn't have an actual debugger
jokbon: 
i know
jokbon: 
it shows line 2 when mistake is in line 1 for out of bounds
jokbon: 
super confusing
jokbon: 
i spent so much time looking whats wrong
tobero: 
Oh, didn't know the version you're using already supported that.
I'll see why it's showing that wrongly
jokbon: 
nono
jokbon:

That's simple: Java sucks. When writing java you write to much boilerplate code.
Kotlin has so many features a modern language supports (Like C#) but java is just stuck in time.

üòÇ üòé
jokbon: 
OKAY
jokbon: 
FIX LORE
jokbon: 
AND
jokbon: 
MAKE RANDOM COMMANDS
jokbon: 
like random action
tobero: 
What do you mean with random? That doesn't make much sense to me
jokbon: 
okay
jokbon: 
lets say i specify multiple spawns
jokbon: 
and it runs random command
jokbon: 
so player gets at random place
jokbon: 
one of examples
tobero: 
Okay, sounds doable
tobero: 
https://github.com/ToberoCat/GuiEngine/wiki/GuiFunctions#random-function Is this implementation okay?
jokbon: 
um not exactly eh
jokbon: 
or maybe i dont understand
jokbon: 
wait
jokbon: 
let me turn on brain
jokbon: 
yes its good implementation
jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero i know another suggestion
jokbon: 
its kinda goes to like expansion
jokbon: 
wait
jokbon: 
nevermind i can alredy do it
jokbon: 
XD
tobero: 
What's already doable?
jokbon: 
voting roulete
jokbon: 
we have perms for guis right?
jokbon: 
xD
tobero: 
Yeah, you can check for permissions with computable functions, if that's what you mean
jokbon: 
not sure but it think vote roulete alredy is posible
jokbon: 
XD
jokbon: 
LMAO
jokbon: 
w gui engine
tobero: 
To be true... I don't really know what you mean with a voting roulete
jokbon: 
vote rewards
jokbon: 
chest
tobero: 
Oh, yeah. YOu should be able to do this
jokbon: 
with vote keys
jokbon: 
LOL
jokbon: 
cant wait someone to abuse votekeys
jokbon: 
by renaming item
jokbon: 
lol
jokbon: 
or is it
tobero: 
Hm... I'm pretty sure gui engine has no possibility to bind a gui to a block and then check for a specific item, but ignoring this.... you should be able to do it
jokbon: 
lol idk
jokbon: 
i think its still posible via external plugin
tobero: 
Yeah, that's for sure
jokbon: 
bind permision comand to item
jokbon: 
gives player perm on click
jokbon: 
can open  chest
jokbon: 
on open remove his item
jokbon: 
xD
jokbon: 
yes something like this
jokbon: 
so its posible
jokbon: 
idk
tobero: 
Okay, so 
1. Do you mean the items provided by guiengine?
2. A command (again)
3. Command (again)
4. Command

Yeah, seems doable
jokbon: 
iam breaking both plugins and minecraft itself at this point

The new config parameters in the config for the power module (Still missing values)
```yml

  # These settings only apply when you enabled this module.
  #
  # This section represents the constants mentioned in the power-raids module documentation.
  # If you have no clue what you're doing here, a good place to start looking would be the power raid module documentation
  power-management:
    base-member-constant: 50 # Note that this is indeed a constant - Therefore changing this might cause balancing issues on your server
    accumulation-rate: # Configure how often faction powers will be accumulated. Increasing it to be too frequent might cause database bottlenecks
      unit: HOURS # The time unit this value will be interpreted as. Some more common possibilities are: SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS and DAYS
      value: 1
    base-accumulation: 0 # Set how much power a faction gets even when no members are online
    accumulation-multiplier: 10 # A value that will get applied at the end
    # This is a constant responsible for rewarding when multiple people of a faction are online simultaneous.
    # It's used in an exponential growth function, so don't make it too big
    accumulation-active-exponent: 2
    # This is a constant responsible for penalizing inactive people of a faction are online simultaneous.
    # It's used in an exponential growth function, so don't make it too big
    accumulation-inactive-multiplier: 2
```

josh65: 
does `accumulation-inactive-multiplier` take power depending on how many player are offline?
tobero: 
Not excatly, but yes. Inactive players are players that haven't been on the server for like 7 days (Configurable), forcing factions to stay active.
tobero: 
Basically, these config options are pretty complex, because I want to support all possible play styles with them- And they kinda achieve it, as you can easily reward & penalise different playstyles and have direct influence on how your players will be playing the game.
A example would be for example by just changing the claim related settings (the maintenance cost and cost growth) you can easily control the sizes of factions - More costly claims will result in lesser chunks getting claimed, making them more valuable to own. On the other hand, you could also easily make players claim the whole world with them.
Same goes for the ideal faction member sizes. They can be shifted with the inactive / active trade-off values.

So yeah, if someone is really going to try change them, the doc I use currently to not get lost will be needed
jokbon: 
okay
jokbon: 
speaking of mysql
jokbon: 
first question
jokbon: 
why there is no option to choose from simple storage and mysql
jokbon: 
üò° üíÄ
jokbon: 
okay now rest of stuff
tobero: 
There is
tobero: 
it uses sqlite as soonas the mysql server isn't available
jokbon: 
oh k
jokbon: 
okay then there could be comment
tobero: 
And this fallback sqlite file is making issues
tobero: 
I'll add it
jokbon: 
"uses sqlite when no mysql avivable"
jokbon: 
ot soemtethiong
jokbon:

jokbon: 
Okay first boot was ww mysql
jokbon:

jokbon:

jokbon: 
blah blah many error
jokbon: 
.
Next boot: improved faction table, login is correct
tobero: 
I don't get what you mean with no schema.Have you set it to no name, or did you delete it while the plugin was running?
jokbon: 
i didnt create improved factions table
tobero: 
isn't it creating that automatically?
jokbon: 
its not and it probaly shudnt create automaticaly
jokbon: 
wait abit
jokbon: 
k
tobero: 
hm, I'm sure that my database manager creates the schemas and tables automatically...
jokbon: 
no it doesnt
jokbon: 
now i will create table
tobero: 
okay, thanks for testing, will try it
tobero: 
try to fix it
jokbon: 
Okay now i created table
it doesnt have previous error
jokbon: 
```[16:08:11 ERROR]: [ImprovedFactions] rank\rank-detail.gui has a invalid component. Rank hasn't been found in the database

jokbon: 
@[Dev] Tobero
tobero: 
yep, this can be ignored
tobero: 
these warnings are just from gui engine gui validation
jokbon: 
so ur factions database perfectly working
jokbon: 
**user just need to create table**
tobero: 
yeah, sqlite is the thing having issues
jokbon: 
*mysql skill isusue
jokbon: 
.
jokbon: 
Okay now testing maria db?
jokbon: 
xD
jokbon: 
iama check version rq
jokbon: 
.
jokbon: 
So without table same error
jokbon: 
after creating ImprovedFactions
jokbon: 
seems to be working
tobero: 
Here are the new icon / banners for improved factions. I'll write a new spigot page because I plan to upload improved factions on modrinth and I can't post the spigot page in it's current state - It's basically a list of things that **were** included

jokbon: 
improyed faction
josh65: 
What is the default max power for a faction? Mines showing 0 which I'm sure is wrong.
tobero: 
Have you just created the faction? Usually it will create a faction with 0 max power, then the owner joins, increasing the max by the configured growth rate. Maybe there's something wrong or a error at this stage
josh65: 
It's an existing faction so I was already joined as the owner
tobero: 
Oh, so you've upgraded a old faction?
tobero: 
"old"
josh65: 
Updated IF and kept the datebase yeah. I found i can change it in the data base just want to know what the default value should be.
tobero: 
Okay, so it depends on your configuration file, but if you kept everything defaulted, it should be 50 when only one member is present
josh65: 
Alright I haven't change the config from default thanks.
tobero: 
But that's actually a great point - I totally missed the upgrading part. Previously existing factions won't get the max power they hsould've received
josh65: 
Is there a way I can set the maintain cost to be daily rather then hourly without effecting the power accumulation for online players.
tobero: 
No, not right now, but it's a very easy feature to add, if you thing it might be better to seperate them
josh65: 
Properly yeah. The current issue I'm having is I'm losing all my power over night while im sleeping so chunks become raidable. Seems a bit unfair.
tobero: 
Hm, yeah. I can see the issue there. But do you think making the maintenance cost a seperate timer fix this issue? Isn't it like a major flaw?
josh65: 
Not sure, I though it would work if the cost was increased by default and done once a day. Then you can know and plan power management around players sleeping before it get taken (based on a server config time).

Maybe there could be a 12 hour delay for maintance cost if there's only an owner in a faction and there offline.
tobero: 
After dynmap, I'll release the wilderness module as well as the home module. They both are currently have finished.

Here's the wilderness config, anything I didn't cover?
```yml
  wilderness:
    cooldown-unit: SECONDS # The time unit this value will be interpreted as. Some more common possibilities are: SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS and DAYS
    cooldown-value: 30 # The time the player has to wait before being able to use the command again
    included-zones: # The zones that should be considered as wilderness. This is a list of zone names
      - unmanaged
    gain-resistance: true # If set to true, the player will gain resistance for 10 seconds when teleporting to the wilderness
    prevent-spawn-over-liquids: true # If set to true, the player won't be teleported over bodies of water
    stand-still-unit: SECONDS
    stand-still-value: 5 # The time the player has to stand still before being teleported
    blacklisted-biomes:
      - OCEAN
    wilderness-limit: -1 # The amount of times a player can use this command to teleport to wilderness. -1 means no limit
    claim-distance-check: 20 # The distance the choosen location will be at least away from a faction claim
    retry-limit: 10 # The amount of times the plugin will try to find a suitable location before giving up
    blacklisted-worlds: # This is a list of worlds where the wilderness command should not work. It automatically includes the blacklisted worlds from the base module
      - world_nether
      - world_the_end
    # Uncomment to choose the regions where the wilderness command should try to teleport the player to. 
    # If no regions are defined, the player will be teleported to a random location within proximity in the same world
    # regions: 
    # default-region:
    # min-x: -1000
    # max-x: 1000
    # min-z: -1000
    # max-z: 1000
    # world: "world"
    
    teleport-proximity: 100 # The proximity the player will be teleported to when no regions are defined
```
josh65: 
What it suppose to do, just teleport players to each other?
josh65: 
Also with the new power set command factions with spaces in the name brakes it. Space should be removed from the regex by default with a warning about it.
tobero: 
It will teleport a player to a random location, that the program thinks is suitable for a new faction, as it's not too close to a different one. Such commands are usually used for servers to spread their players around the world
tobero: 
Oh, that's a good point. But even though by disabling the spaces by default, I still have to change the command to allow for them
josh65: 
I've notice that faction info isn't loading either. Even though I copied the config from the #‚ï∞Ôºûüíæ„Öêdev-files pastebin.

tobero: 
This is a issue I've encountered while testing, usually reloading the plugin fixes it. It's a very weird thing that the config isn't loaded correctly.
You would also have to make sure that the dynmap config is located under factions.dynmap
josh65: 
So I put under the factions section indented like the others options and it give more info on the map but crashes the plugin

This is pretty weird. The marker that doesn't exist gets created two lines above.
I'll have to check that

Have you done any specific configuration for dynmap? Are there any errors above?

jokbon: 
or something like that

I know, but this marker has been created in the same function two lines above
jokbon: 
can u show code part?
jokbon: 
im not a java coder but hope i can spot bug

@[Dev] Tobero try marker = markSet.createAreaMarker
jokbon: 
and try public
jokbon: 
idk
jokbon: 
i might be wrong XD
jokbon: 
public is needed cause else it only visible within file right?
jokbon: 
one of those should work i think
tobero: 
But this method is only needed within the file
tobero: 
The failure is on dynmaps side, not mine. Dynmap for some reason returns no marker for this, so my guess would be that the market already exists for some reason, even though I remove all markers before
jokbon: 
it doesnt exist if its null
tobero: 
The method doesn't return anything, because it's unable to create the marker - Therefore, the only reason for it to fail would be the same marker already exists
jokbon: 
i mean others areable to post same markers
tobero: 
But not with the same id. The id would have to be different
jokbon: 
did u try to set marker with diferent id each time
jokbon: 
u can actualy try to do that
tobero: 
The id is unique based on the x, y and world, so yeah. But still, if the same claim would get rendered twice for some reason, this would cause it to fail
tobero: 
The id has to be directly associated with the position, for later removal
jokbon: 
can if be used as survival plugin atm? (unraidable)
tobero: 
Depends on what you need for survival. Raiding can be disabled, if you mean that
jokbon: 
i think if u set marker color that alredy exist would throw something else
tobero: 
I don't think so, it's a null pointer telling me there's something missing- in this case the return value of the create function
jokbon: 
https://www.tabnine.com/code/java/methods/org.dynmap.markers.MarkerSet/createAreaMarker
jokbon: 
there are other implementations but in java i think
josh65: 
Theres no other errors in the log, haven't change anything specific with markers in Dynmap.
josh65: 
Here the config file might be somthing I did wrong.

@Josh65  can u try compiling without position.world, my compiler got bugged
jokbon: 
lets see if thats the isusue
jokbon: 
(it doesn't find java even tho its instaled and defined in sys variables)
josh65: 
Compile the plugin? I'm using the #‚ï∞Ôºûüíæ„Öêdev-files downloads
jokbon: 
i think some values are missing and thus api dont fire the creation
jokbon: 
i didnt found where it gets position .world
tobero: 
I'll take a look at once home again, this shouldn't be a hard to fix problem
josh65: 
Dynmap working again. I really like the teleport effect too.
tobero: 
Amazing. I'll be releasing it once I've redesigned the spigot /modrith page
jokbon: 
https://tenor.com/view/tokyo-mew-mew-mew-ichigo-ichigo-momomiya-ichigo-mew-mew-gif-27708831
jokbon: 
XD
jokbon: 
realised Random from gui engine got flaw
jokbon: 
it doesnt have chance
tobero: 
Home Module now has been fully integrated. Currently rewriting the plugin page. Once that's done, I'll release these three new modules
